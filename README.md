Basketball analysis

- Find difference between win % for home and away games for each team, and check for correlation
- Check correlation between the two seasons as well
- Check difference in winrates from home and away vs their overall winrate for the season
- Create a graph from that data
- Find median of team audience population
- Compare difference of audience population with overall winrate of team
- Try to predict projected winrate from audience population, and perhaps vice versa as well
